          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This game allows player to make choices and affect the outcome of certain events, both
          big and small.The beautifully written plot of this game accompanying with awesome chill soundtrack really enhances the overall
          gameplay, not only that, you also have the ability to rewind time.There is also a lot of topics in the game where one would 
          deem uncomfortable(Death,Suicide,Assault) for most sensitive people but this games deal with the problem well.It was a
          emotional ride for me while playing as I made hard(and maybe wrong)choices in the game, which kind of reminisce of my own life.
         Overall, I would say that this is more of a experience for me than a game.

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Humanity has successfully colonize Aqua aka Mars and made it 
          into a beautiful water city call Venezia(name inspired by Venice).While this sounds like this show
          has a heavy sci-fi element,it has but only paltry influence on the show as a whole. This anime focuses
          more on the lifes of 3 Undines, Akari, Aika and Alice with their mentor Alicia, Akira and Athena.
          Undine are pretty much tour gondola rowers similar
          to the one in Venice here on Earth. The whole plot of the anime is just to show these 
          3 characters striving to become a full-fledge Undine and one day be able to fetch real tourist.While that is
          general plot of the show,due to the episodic nature of the anime,we meet various other residents of Aqua
         and strange phenomenon happening in the city.

      <p class="review">
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This show really did well in providing comfort and warmth with it's 
        chill soundtrack and a calming opening theme which could put a crying baby to sleep(Hyperbole but 
        get my point).If you get invested enough with these characters you will definitely feel emotional 
        at the end of the series.Love this anime.

      <p class="review">
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While this show tends toward a younger audience, This cartoon by no means a 
        shallow series. It has plot twist that is hinted throughout the show and strong comedy and moral theme that will
        be a good influence for kids watching, even adults too in my opinion.

      <p class="review">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's better than a good cold drink of beer,wine and/or liquor 
        after a tiring work,becoming someone who serves beer,wine and liquor.You play as a bartender 
        , Jill Stingray , in a bar name VA-11 HA-11-A. As Jill keeps listening and attracting 
        "fascinating" clientele hearing about their weird chaotic life in Glitch City as she serves them drinks.

      <p class="review">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this game is visual novel rather than a physical handheld novel, It does not
        lack story-telling element like character and world building, in my most humble opinion having characters that are
        simple but with deep thoughts and their own struggle can really make me or most of us relate to the characters, is the 
        second most important thing in a story,which is what this game did well.
        Interacting with a variety of characters in VA-11 has been the most fun
        I had in a while. Eventhough they are fictional characters ,you can still feel their struggle in Glitch
        City as technology has progress significantly and android are ubiquitous, Not to say that the
         game has awesome pixel art and AMAZING soundtracks whilst also needing memory skills so that you will be able to 
         decipher vague customer orders. Most importantly, Dogs in this game can speak and catgirls are real(Hooray to real
         life catgirls :D ).
