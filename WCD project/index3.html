     <p class="review">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This game which I regard as the Game of the Year for 2017
        (Not that i have played alot of games) is just absolutely amazing.
        As Earth has been overrun by machine life-form created by alien, humanity hopes to
        bring back their homeland by deploying androids to eradicate the machine life-form,
         you  follow the journey of android 2B and 9S as they complete their missions given by 
         the headquarter.But is all seems as simple as that?
     </p>
      <p class="review">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well that was the simplest synopsis,Now come to why you should play 
      NieR:Automata, this game has non-repetitive combat gameplay with a bullet hell aspect to the game
      as you upgrade your weapons and chip with enticing plot
       to keep you on your toes for a long time as you explore the vast and beautiful world. Accompanying that ,you will 
      be in a emotional wildride as you uncover the truth  about humans,androids and machine life-form. As 
      you question the purpose of existence of androids and machine-lifeform.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine a world where a small percentage of human is able to use psychokinesis(PK user),
         however the rest of humanity cannot condone such a different and unknown creature,This induced fear causes
        a public outcry to eliminate the PK user which in the end follows a downfall of civilisation, one century later,
        we follow the story of Shun, Saki, Maria, Satoru and Mamoru. As weird events unfold in their eye and they find 
        outs the truth of the society they live in .</p>
        <p class="review">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This show clearly depicts humanity's fear of the unknown as a whole and how 
          they response to the unknown. Accompanying that with a eery soundtrack and with horror elements really makes this 
          show stands out from other. There is this mixed emotion I have after watching the show it's hard to explain 
          it really makes you wonder about the humanity, 
          whether we are just a bunch of horrible nuts or this is just how nature made us to be.You can really feel the
          humanity's typical distaste towards human of different kinds and will do anything neccesary to eradicate them if 
        push comes to shove, all in the name of protecting humanity.</p>

          <p class="review">
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black Mirror exposes the ugliness of humanity through the advancement 
              of technology . E.g what if we have a social credit system where everyone rates other people from 1 Star 
              to 5 star through their phone, and the higher your rate of star ,the more privilege you will get or a 
              technology where you implant a device in your children's brain so that you can monitor his/ or her heartrate 
              /location/and vision. This show really provokes thought experiment as our current society and technology 
              may progress or even surpass that stage  as shown in the series, it reallys make you self reflect about
              your own philosophy,principle and beliefs.

             <p class="review">
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1984 is a dystopia novel that depicts a society where freedom of anything
              is non-existential,Telescreen(which acts as a television,security cameras and microphone) are always recording 
              and any action or speech of betrayal or opposing ideology against the Party 
              ( even when you sleep-talks)will result in appearance of Thought Police. We follow the life of Winston Smith,
               a person who does not fit well in this society as his feeling of rebellion grows when 
               he thought there might be hope for a future he canlive in a world where The Party cannot interfere with him.

              <p class="review">  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This novel has potray a well depicted dystopian society, where people
                has been brainwashed and indoctrinated from young to fit with society standards set by the one
                with powers aka "The Party". You can really feel the helplessness and loneliness of being a person 
                like Winston who can either only thinkhe is the crazy one or the rest of the world is insane .
                 On the other hand ,
